      <p> There are many defintions of love.  According to the Merriam Webster's Dictionary there are at least 8 definitions of love. Here are the ones I find most important.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>A strong affection for another arising out of kinship or personal ties.</li>
        <li> An attraction based on sexual desire :  affection and tenderness felt by lovers.</li>
        <li>An affection based on admiration, benevolence, or common interests.</li>
        <li>A warm attachment, enthusiasm, or devotion.</li>
        <li>The object of attachment, devotion, or admiration.</li>
